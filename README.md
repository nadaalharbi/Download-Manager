# Download-Manager 
Download Manager’s idea is to fetch a list of users to table. Each row has user's profile image and name. and download the images/data with different format.
The App is using Cache to download images to cache and retrieve it instead of calling the webservice each time.
The App is using Cocoapods libraries such as, Reachability to check user’s connection.
